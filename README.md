# PotMount
A potentiometer dust cover with M3 mounting holes for use as standoff

# Usage
1) Open the FreeCAD project and check out the dimensions. Change the inner and outer diameters as necessary to match your potentiometer. The current values will work to slip over the back of whatever ALPHA pots Tayda is selling right now (that's what i have at hand)
2) Turn your 3D printer loose on that bad boy

# Background
I like to make synthesizer electronics in Eurorack format, but i often forget to leave room for a PCB mount or standoff. Meanwhile, the modules almost always have a pot in a great spot to hold the board. This model provides a nice way to get the PCB mounted to the potentiometer without much further fabrication. I would recommend a dab of glue though to keep things solid.

# Contributing
This is just a quick thing i whipped up. I'm barely proficient with FreeCAD, but i'd love to see this project evolve into something that other hobbyists can quickly print up. A good first start would be better documentation for the constraints of interest, and then re-organizing the project according to best practices and readability.
